# Price Finder For TacoBell Items

This will ultimately become a website that allows the user to enter a location of their choice and a ranking of taco bells and their corresponding prices,
will be returned. The idea is to create a website where anybody can monitor the price differences between stores AND see each store's rating from different sources.
The website will give consumers more insight into what they're signing up for when they get Taco Bell. The initial proof of concept is being built for Taco Bell now
but will be extended to other food places upon completion.
